How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    help me check typo errors

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    check the history in case of regretion

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    having versions automatically saved only keep the newest version of a file, not a whole history.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is designed for programmers and developers to maintain the whole directory of files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    type git log and git diff in git bash

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    don't need to heisitate whether to modify.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    maintain my project

从长远来看，能轻松访问文件的整个历史记录将如何提高编程者的效率？
	能够保存历史文档，回顾之前的工作，检查错误，写更新日志。

你认为，手动选择何时创建提交（像在 Git 中做的那样）与自动保存版本（如 Google Docs 所做的那样）各有何优缺点？
	可以根据逻辑更改进行版本控制。

为何你认为一些版本控制系统（例如 Git）允许在一次提交中保存多个文件，而其他系统（例如 Google Docs）单独对待每个文件？
	便于追踪多个文件

如何使用命令 git log 和 git diff 来查看文件的历史记录？
	git log
	git diff id1 id2

使用版本控制，如何让你更有信心进行有可能会造成破坏的更改？
	可以使用git checkout 恢复到之前的版本

现在你已设置了工作空间，你想尝试使用 Git 来做些什么？
	进行版本控制
